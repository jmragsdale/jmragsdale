Hi, I'm Jermaine 👋🏾
Enterprise Security Engineer | Zero-Trust Architect | Cloud Security Specialist

I architect secure, compliant cloud infrastructure that protects sensitive data while enabling business innovation. My focus is on implementing zero-trust frameworks, automating security controls, and building defense-in-depth strategies across enterprise SaaS platforms and cloud environments.

🔐 What I Do
Implement zero-trust architectures with identity-first security (SAML, OAuth, SCIM)
Secure enterprise platforms including AzureAD, GSuite, GitHub, and cloud infrastructure
Deploy endpoint security solutions with EDR tools and conditional access policies
Automate security monitoring with SIEM integration and threat detection systems
Enforce email security protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and anti-phishing controls
Build policy-as-code frameworks to prevent misconfigurations and enforce guardrails
Develop security automation using Python and Bash for scalable protection
Drive security awareness through employee education and secure-by-default practices
Automate compliance for SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA frameworks
